# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #5

## Title
Collaboration. Complex application.

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 **(2 pt)**
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) **(1 pt)**

	   * **Gaitur** Iurie has the responsibility to:  
		  - create the repository on _github_
		  - find a bitmap imagine which will be used 
		  - create _checkboxes_
      - create random access of pictures, when button new game is clicked 

  	* **Barbaros Nicolae** has the responsibility to:
  		- create the sketch for aplication
      - dissable window resize option
      - get the screen coordonates
      - implement the algorithm of finding the differences
      - add SFX


    * **Leahu Luminita** has the responsibility to:
    	- initialize the project and push it on github
    	- initialize the _Readme_ file 		
    	- create custom _Icon_ and _menu_ for application
      - import bitmap files to apllication
      - create the title and the story
      - add actions to _checkboxes_, if a difference is found - one is checked
      - create dialogboxes
      - clean up and make the code visible

* Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) **(2 pt)**
  
  Our application is not so useful, but is a perfect game for kids. It is an interestig and funny mini-game which develop the spirit of observation. 

* First create a sketch, then work on code **(1 pt)** _(commit sketches early)_
